<h1>GreenFoot Game</h1>
This project involves the development of a simple interactive game using the Greenfoot framework. My game features a character named Tux, balloons, fish, and bombs. The goal is to create an engaging and dynamic environment where the player can control Tux, avoiding bombs while interacting with other objects.
