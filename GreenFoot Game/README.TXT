<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project involves the development of a simple interactive game using the Greenfoot framework. The game features a character named Tux, balloons, fish, and bombs. The goal is to create an engaging and dynamic environment where the player can control Tux, avoiding bombs while interacting with other objects.

Key Features
1. **Interactive Gameplay:**
   - Control Tux using arrow keys.
   - Press 'S' to start or restart the game.

2. **Dynamic Object Placement:**
   - Random placement of balloons, fish, and bombs within the game world.
   - Ensuring bombs are not placed too close to Tux's starting position to avoid immediate game over scenarios.

3. **User Instructions:**
   - Displaying instructions on how to start and control the game at the beginning.

#### Technical Details
- **Greenfoot Library:** Utilizing Greenfoot to create and manage the game environment and objects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementation of game logic using Java and object-oriented principles.

#### Code Overview
- **Class: MyWorld**
  - Inherits from Greenfoot's World class to create the game world.
  - Contains constants for the game world's dimensions and a flag to manage spawning.

Methods:
  - **Constructor (MyWorld):** Initializes the game world and displays instructions.
  - **prepare():** Clears existing objects and reinitializes the game environment.
  - **addTux():** Adds the Tux character to the game world.
  - **addBalloons(int count):** Adds a specified number of balloons at random positions.
  - **addFish(int count):** Adds a specified number of fish at random positions.
  - **addRandomBombs(int count):** Adds a specified number of bombs at random positions, ensuring they are not too close to Tux's starting position.
  - **act():** Continuously checks for user input to start or restart the game.
